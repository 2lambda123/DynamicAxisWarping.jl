Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and related algorithms in Julia.

This package is a fork of https://github.com/ahwillia/TimeWarp.jl which is no longer maintained.

*Warning:* This package is under active development and the API is likely to break.

This package isn't officially registered. Install using:

```julia
using Pkg
pkg"add https://github.com/baggepinnen/DynamicAxisWarping.jl"
```

## Simple usage

Inputs of dimension larger than 1 will be treated as sequences where time is in the last dimension. When using higher-dimensional series, make sure the provided distance accepts them.

Any distance from Distances.jl works, as well as functions on the form `dist(x,y) -> ‚Ñù`.

```julia
using DynamicAxisWarping, Distances, Plots
cost, i1, i2 = dtw(a,b, [dist=SqEuclidean()]; transportcost = 1)
cost, i1, i2 = fastdtw(a,b, [dist=SqEuclidean()])
cost = dtw_cost(a, b, dist, radius) # Optimized method that only returns cost. Supports early stopping, see docstring. Can be made completely allocation free.

dtwplot(a,b, [dist=SqEuclidean()]; transportcost = 1)

centers, clustids, result = dbaclust(data, nclust, FastDTW(10))

# dtw supports arbitrary upper and lower bound vectors constraining the warping path.
imin,imax = radiuslimits(5,20,20), plot([imin imax])
dtw(a, b, dist, imin, imax) # Cost eqivalent to dtw_cost(a, b, dist, 5)
```

## Find a short pattern in a long time series
The function `dtwnn` searches for a pattern in a long time series. It's currently not super well optimized, and *does not normalize* the data over each window.

```julia
using DynamicAxisWarping, Distances
radius = 5
a      = sin.(0.1 .* (1:100))     .+ 0.1 .* randn.()
b      = sin.(0.1 .* (1:100_000)) .+ 0.1 .* randn.()
res    = dtwnn(a, b, SqEuclidean(), radius) # takes about 0.1s # DynamicAxisWarping.DTWSearchResult(0.4625287975222824, 73452, (prune_end = 79108, prune_env = 0))
plot([a b[eachindex(a) .+ (res.loc-1)]])
```

#### Optimizations
The following optimizations are implemented.
- [x] Endpoint lower bound pruning
- [ ] Envelope lower bound pruning
- [x] DTW early termination
- [ ] Online normalization
- [ ] Sorting of query series





#### `transportcost`
`transportcost` adds an additional penalty multiplier for "transporting", i.e., deviations from the Euclidean matching. The standard DTW distance does not consider this added cost and the default is 1. A value greater than 1 multiplies the cost of moving horizontally or vertically in the coupling matrix, promoting a diagnoal move, corresponding to the standard Euclidean matching. The influence of the transport cost can be visualized with
```julia
a = sin.(1:100); b = sin.(1:100) .+ randn.();
dtwplot(a,b, transportcost=1)    # Default
dtwplot(a,b, transportcost=1.01) # Should be "more diagnoal"
dtwplot(a,b, transportcost=1.1)  # Should be almost completely diagnoal
```
You can try a `transportcost < 1` as well, but then it is preferable to make weird alignments and I'm not sure how much sense that would make.

See also function `dba` for barycenter averaging, but note that `dba` is known to not always produce the best barycenters. See, e.g., ["Soft-DTW: a Differentiable Loss Function for Time-Series"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.01541.pdf) or ["Spatio-Temporal Alignments: Optimal transport through space and time"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.03860.pdf) for a method that produces better barycenters at the expense of a much higher computational cost.

#### Combine with optimal transport
The distance between two datapoints can be any distance supporting the [Distances.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/Distances.jl/) interface.

See the file [`frequency_warping.jl`](https://github.com/baggepinnen/DynamicAxisWarping.jl/blob/master/examples/frequency_warping.jl) ([notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/baggepinnen/julia_examples/blob/master/frequency_warping.ipynb)) for an example combining dynamic time warping with optimal transport along the frequency axis for spectrograms. This example makes use of [SpectralDistances.jl](https://github.com/baggepinnen/SpectralDistances.jl).
